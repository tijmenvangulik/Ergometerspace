There are two different ways of organizing team rowing events.

## 1) Users login manually 

Use this when you have users which already are using ergometer-space and want have a great amount of self organization. (For example when you row with your own team which is using ergometer space for some time. Or when you want to test the team rowing )

## 2) Users login using direct login links
This method greatly simplifies the organization and the amount of work for the users (rowers)). You will send users a link (url) and the link will directly login the user into the correct room/team and gives the user an dashboard optimized for their role.
