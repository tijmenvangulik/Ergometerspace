This app is created just for fun. I am not interested in your data or am a selling your data to third parties. Data is stored as much as possible in the local storage on your device or pc. 

When you connect to a room and row together with other rowers your speed/position is shared with other users. Highscores are also stored on the server when you enter an ergometer-room. When you row together the data is send as much as possible directly to the other users in your room using peer to peer technology. This gives more privacy because your data is not send to a central server.

For technical purposes I keep an log of alle the errors on the server. The server is only used when you connect to your room. When your connect to a room your user name and connection type is logged. I use this info because I want to know how much the app is used. But since a user name you can create your own temporary user name, I do not know who you are unless you use a username which can be traced back to you. This information is only stored temporary and your data is not shared with third a party.
