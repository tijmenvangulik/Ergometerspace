This app is created just for fun. I am not interested in your data or am a selling your data to third parties. Data is stored as much as possible in the local storage on your device or pc.

When you connect to a room and row together with other rowers your speed/position is shared with other users. Highscores are also stored on the server when you enter an ergometer-room. 

For technical purposes I keep an log of alle the errors on the server. The server is only used when you connect to your room.
