This app is created just for fun. I am not interested in your data or am selling your data to third parties. Data is stored as much as possible in the local storage on your device or PC.

When you connect to a room and row together with other rowers, your speed/position is shared with other users. High scores are also stored on the server when you enter an ergometer room. When you row together, the data is sent as much as possible directly to the other users in your room using peer-to-peer technology. This provides more privacy because your data is not sent to a central server.

For technical purposes, I keep a log of all the errors on the server. The server is only used when you connect to a room. When you connect to a room, your username and connection type are logged. I use this info because I want to know how much the app is used. But since you can create your own username, I do not know who you are unless you use a username which can be traced back to you. This information is only stored temporarily and your data is not shared with a third party.
